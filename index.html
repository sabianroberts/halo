        <h1>Make It Before the Sunset!</h1>
        <p>
        In December 2021, 343 Industries are closing the online matchmaking servers for all the Halo games on the Xbox 360, including Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, Halo: Reach & Halo: CE Anniversary and Halo 4. It is saddening how little players there are on all games after 343's announcement back in December 2020; so let's get these games alive again!
        There's not much time. We only have ten months and Bungie have already closed halo.bungie.net. So why not dust off your old copy of Halo 3, or even your old Xbox 360, and find some friends to play with in matchmaking?
        There's no specific time for an event - we just want the games back in their prime before they shutdown to custom games only...
        </p>
        <h1>FAQ / Help</h1>
        <h2>What Halo games are on the Xbox 360?</h2>
        <p>
            The <i>Halo</i> games that are available on the Xbox 360 are Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, Halo Wars, Halo: Reach,
            Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary (please note that other than Campaign, Halo Anniversary has the same multiplayer as Halo: Reach)
            and Halo 4.
        </p>
        <h2>I don't want Halo Anniversary. How can I play its multiplayer?</h2>
        <p>
            Download the Anniversary free DLC for Halo: Reach. The Anniversary playlists in Reach's matchmaking is basically Halo: CE Anniversary's online multiplayer.
            <b>We recommend that you get all the free DLCs for all Xbox 360 Halo games you own.</b>
        </p>
        <h2>I don't own any Xbox 360 Halo games. Where can I buy them?</h2>
        <p>
            Because 343i want us to buy into their Master Chief Collection, they have halted all digital sales of the Xbox 360 Halo games (if you already own them digitally you can still re-download them).
            If you do not already own any Xbox 360 Halo games digitally, you will have to get them on disc. We recommend that you purchase a copy that isn't a classics/greatest hits version and look on Amazon
            and/or eBay. You can always still look at the store of your choice for the Xbox 360 Halo games.
        </p>
        <h2>I don't have an Xbox 360. How am I supposed to play these games?</h2>
        <p>
            Worry not! You can still pickup a disc copy of the Xbox 360 Halo games and play them on your Xbox One, Xbox One S, Xbox One X and/or Xbox Series X. Unfortunately, you
            cannot play the disc copies on your Xbox One S All-Digital Edition or Xbox Series S as they lack a disc drive. The only way to play them on those consoles is if your or a friend (who
            is willing to share)'s account already owns the game(s) digitally.
        </p>
        <h2>What should I do to help the games regain popularity?</h2>
        <p>
            Just head over to matchmaking, pick a playlist and that's it. <br /> P.S. we recommend you use a mic and chat with the other players... it will
            make the game feel a whole lot more sociable and just like the old days.
        </p>
        <h2>Where can I find players to play with and/or where can I post my gamertag?</h2>
        <p> Try <a href="https://reddit.com/r/xbox360">r/xbox360 the Xbox 360 Hub,</a> or the <a href="https://discord.gg/YEA4BHxkQv">Halo 3 Discord server (NOT affiliated with Bungie, Microsoft or 343i).</a> </p>
